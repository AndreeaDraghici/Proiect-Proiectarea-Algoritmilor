# Proiect-Proiectarea-Algoritmilor

TASK:


Selection of activities. It is considered a lot of activities so
each of them requires exclusive access to a common resource. For each activity knows the start time and duration. 
It is required to mining a subset of maximum cardinality of these activities so that any two selected activities are mutually compatible (no
overlap in time). Implement two different algorithms. ( in Python & C ).



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this repository there are implemented 2 algorithms, both in C language and in Python, also this project also has an editable technical report in LaTex as well as a pdf generated automatically from LaTex. 
The requirement of the task is above, see also the technical report in LaTex or directly the pdf related to it.
